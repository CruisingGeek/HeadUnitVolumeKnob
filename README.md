# HeadUnitVolumeKnob
Putting this Arduino module between your aftermarket Android head unit with a rotary encoder allows volume control via the knob. Requires 2 n-channel MOSFETs to be driven from the Arduino Pro Micro

## Hardware
This code has been written to run on an Arduino Pro Micro. It should be easy to port it to other Arduino boards.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the CruisingGeekCommon library. Unpack that library into your Arduino libraries folder.
